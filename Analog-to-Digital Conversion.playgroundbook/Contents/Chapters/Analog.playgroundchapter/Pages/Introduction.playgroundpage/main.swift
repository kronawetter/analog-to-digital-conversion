When you take an ECG on your Apple Watch, an electronic circuit is capturing tiny electrical voltages produced by your heart’s activity. However, the voltages captured by the circuit are analog, while the processor in your Apple Watch only works with digital signals. Therefore, the analog data needs to be converted to digital before it can enter the processor. Have you ever wondered how such a conversion works? In this Playground Book we will explore what it takes to convert analog signals to digital ones.

- Note:
There are several types of electronic circuits that can be used for analog-to-digital conversion. This Playground Book presents one of them in a simplified manner. It is unknown to me which type of circuit is used for the ECG functionality in Apple Watch.

I’m an Electronics and Computer Engineering student and besides Apple platforms, my passion is embedded software development. Creating software that directly interacts with the physical world is what I enjoy so much about this field.
